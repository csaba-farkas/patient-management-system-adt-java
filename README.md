<h1>Patient Management System<h1>
<h2>Assignment 1 - Algorithms and Data Structures</h2>
<h3>Assignment title: Abstract Data Types</h3>

<strong>Project scope</strong>: Build a java application that is capable of utilising the functionality offered by two data structure
classes, which in turn implement a common ADT interface. Your code should be accompanied by a
report that outlines your application idea and the process of implementation you adopted. 

<strong>Solution: </strong> I created a patient management system with no graphical interface. Patient objects can be stored in two
different data structures:

<i>Data Structure 1: </i>Doubly-linked list data structure implemented in PatientLinkedList.java, using Node.java as node objects
<i>Data Structure 2: </i>ArrayList data structure implemented in PatientArrayList.java

To switch between data structures, uncomment line 35 or 36 in PatientManagementApplication.java.
